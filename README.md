Code Explanation
React State Management: We use useState hooks to track:

The current question index
The selected answer for each question
The user's score
Whether the quiz has been completed
Quiz Questions: Questions are stored in an array, where each object represents a question with its options and the correct answer.

Quiz Logic:

When the user selects an answer and clicks Next, the app checks if the answer is correct and updates the score.
If the user reaches the end of the quiz, the score and a personalized message are displayed.
Tailwind CSS Styling: Tailwind CSS is used for responsive styling, buttons, and layout alignment. The app has a clean and simple UI with hover effects and visual feedback for selected answers.

Conditional Messages: Based on the userâ€™s score, the app displays different messages:

Perfect Score: "Congratulations, you're a legend!"
Below 4: "Try harder another time!"
Other Scores: "Quiz Completed!"
